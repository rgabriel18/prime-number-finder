# Prime-number-finder

This code is just an exercise meant to create a Java program that works with Maven and Spring.

However it does work! In case you want to find the longest sequence of consecutive prime numbers in the decimals of a number such as pi.

For this the biggest prime number considered is 9973, so prime numbers with 4 digits.

## Remember to have maven and spring in your computer for this to work.
